        <p>Garlic butter is a paste made of butter and mashed garlic. 
            It originally belonged to the French cuisine and was known as Beurre d'Ail in French. 
            It is now being used in various cuisines due to its versatility. The garlic butter has the spicy taste of garlic with a creamy spreadable consistency. 
            It was primarily used to flavor an appetizer called Escargots Ã  la bourguignonne. 
            It is traditionally used as a spread on garlic bread. Escargots, roasted mushrooms, creamy garlic prawns, steak with garlic butter, mussels, 
            and vegetable stir-fries are some recipes which use garlic butter
