    <h2 id="tran">Kimi no na wa</h2>
    <p>Mitsuha is the daughter of the mayor of a small mountain town. She's a straightforward high school girl who lives with her sister and her grandmother and has no qualms about letting it be known that she's uninterested in Shinto rituals or helping her father's electoral campaign. Instead she dreams of leaving the boring town and trying her luck in Tokyo. Taki is a high school boy in Tokyo who works part-time in an Italian restaurant and aspires to become an architect or an artist. Every night he has a strange dream where he becomes...a high school girl in a small mountain town.</p>

    <h2 id="chic">Garlic Buttered Shrimp</h2>
    <p>Garlic butter is a paste made of butter and mashed garlic. It originally belonged to the French cuisine and was known as Beurre d'Ail in French. It is now being used in various cuisines due to its versatility. The garlic butter has the spicy taste of garlic with a creamy spreadable consistency. It was primarily used to flavor an appetizer called Escargots Ã  la bourguignonne. It is traditionally used as a spread on garlic bread. Escargots, roasted mushrooms, creamy garlic prawns, steak with garlic butter, mussels, and vegetable stir-fries are some recipes which use garlic butter.</p>

    <h2 id="val">Valorant</h2>
    <p>Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future.[2][3][4][5] 
        Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.[5]
         In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. 
        Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, 
        deaths, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charge.[3]
        Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on 
        the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the spike. 
        The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, 
        shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[6][7] There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons 
        that have a shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.[7] 
        Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, 
        and hunters of every description. It currently offers 15 agents to choose from.[8][9] 
        They are Brimstone, Phoenix, Sage, Sova, Viper, Cypher, Reyna, Killjoy, Breach, Omen, Jett, Raze, Skye, Yoru, and Astra.</p>
